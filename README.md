# static_binary_selenium_webdriver_chrome_121
A boilerplate setup for selenium scripts using chrome 121.x.x.x and webdriver 121.x.x.x

What's the Point?:

I spent like two whole days figuring out how to set up selenium with a chrome webdriver for some really basic browser automation.

Apparently this area of coding is going through some major changes, because in the last 4 months there's been a release of a major toolkit that automatically finds and installs a webdriver, in response to a new release/policy (as of the past year) from google of allowing developers to pin their google chrome version at all.

A new library from opensource and a new decision from a company both in the past year seems pretty 'breaking-changes' to me, so I'm hoping to preserve the two days of my time by making a boilerplate repo that can use the webdriver with a venv and binaries both contained in the same repo.

Should be the tinned fish of SDET for webapps, at least that's the dream.

Setup:
1) install and open PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
2) clone and run
